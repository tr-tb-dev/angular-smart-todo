# Smart To-Do List (Angular 16)

## Overview
This project is a **Smart To-Do List** built with **Angular 16.2.x**.  
The goal of the project is to demonstrate **real-world Angular application architecture**, rather than a simple tutorial-level CRUD example.

The focus is on:
- event-driven state management
- undo functionality
- offline-capable persistence
- performance-oriented Angular patterns
- consistent UI built with Angular Material

---

## Tech Stack

- **Angular 16.2.x** – standalone components, Angular CLI
- **TypeScript**
- **RxJS** – action streams and state derivation
- **Angular Material** – accessible, production-ready UI components
- **IndexedDB** (via Dexie ) – persistent offline storage
- **Reactive Forms**
- **ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush**

---

## Architecture Summary

The application follows an **event-driven state model**.

User interactions emit **actions** into an RxJS stream.  
Application state is derived using the `scan` operator, which allows immutable state transitions and enables **undo support** without a global store.

UI-related state (filters, selection, loading flags) is handled via RxJS streams and reflected in Angular Material components, keeping presentation and domain logic clearly separated.

Persistence is implemented using **IndexedDB**, ensuring data survives page reloads and browser restarts while remaining fully asynchronous.

---

## State Management Approach

- All state changes are expressed as explicit user actions
- RxJS `scan` builds the current state over time
- Previous states are stored to support undo operations
- State updates are immutable and deterministic

This approach keeps the architecture simple while still supporting advanced interaction patterns.

---

## Offline & Storage Strategy

- Todo items and lists are stored in **IndexedDB**
- Storage access is asynchronous and non-blocking
- The application remains usable after refresh or temporary network loss
- Only domain data is persisted; UI state remains in memory

---

## Performance Considerations

- `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`
- `trackBy` functions for list rendering
- `async` pipe for subscription handling
- Efficient change detection with Angular Material components

---

## Why This Project

This project demonstrates:
- idiomatic Angular 16 patterns
- practical RxJS usage beyond basic subscriptions
- offline-first thinking with browser-native storage
- structured, accessible UI using Angular Material
- clean separation of concerns without heavy frameworks

The goal is to reflect **enterprise-grade Angular development practices** in a compact, understandable example.
